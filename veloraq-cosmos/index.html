  <h2>Planets of Our Solar System</h2>
  <p>
    The solar system consists of eight planets orbiting the Sun, each with unique
    physical characteristics and atmospheric conditions. Studying planets helps
    scientists understand planetary formation and evolution.
  </p>
  <p>
    From rocky terrestrial planets like Earth and Mars to gas giants such as Jupiter
    and Saturn, every planet contributes to our understanding of cosmic mechanics
    and gravitational interactions.

  <p>
    Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars beyond our solar system. Thousands of
    such worlds have been discovered using modern space telescopes and detection
    methods like the transit technique.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some exoplanets exist in habitable zones where liquid water may be possible.
    Although these worlds are distant, their study expands our understanding of
    planetary diversity and the potential for extraterrestrial life.
