<!-- ORIGIN -->
<section id="origin">
<h2>The Origin of the Universe</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1462332420958-a05d1e002413?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Big Bang">
<p>
The universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago in an event known as the Big Bang. Contrary to popular imagery, this was not an explosion occurring at a single point in space, but rather an expansion of space itself from an extremely hot and dense initial state.
<br><br>
As the universe expanded, temperatures dropped, allowing fundamental particles to form atoms. Over time, gravity caused matter to clump together, leading to the formation of stars and galaxies. Evidence for the Big Bang comes from the cosmic microwave background radiation, the observed expansion of galaxies, and the abundance of light elements.
<br><br>
Understanding the universe’s origin allows scientists to reconstruct cosmic history and test physical laws under extreme conditions. The Big Bang theory remains the most comprehensive and well-supported explanation of our universe’s beginning.

<!-- GALAXIES -->
<section id="galaxies">
<h2>Galaxies and Their Types</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450849608880-6f787542c88a?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Galaxy">
<p>
Galaxies are enormous systems containing stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. They are the fundamental building blocks of the large-scale structure of the universe. Astronomers classify galaxies into several main types, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
<br><br>
Spiral galaxies, such as the Milky Way, feature rotating arms filled with star-forming regions. Elliptical galaxies are generally older, with less gas and little ongoing star formation. Irregular galaxies lack a defined shape and are often shaped by gravitational interactions.
<br><br>
By studying galaxies, scientists gain insight into cosmic evolution, dark matter distribution, and the processes that govern star formation across billions of years.

<!-- STARS -->
<section id="stars">
<h2>Stars: Birth, Life, and Death</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470229722913-7c0e2dbbafd3?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Stars">
<p>
Stars form within vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. Under gravity, dense regions collapse and heat up until nuclear fusion ignites in their cores. This fusion process converts hydrogen into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy.
<br><br>
Throughout their lives, stars maintain a balance between outward energy pressure and inward gravitational force. The mass of a star determines its lifespan and fate. Smaller stars evolve slowly and end as white dwarfs, while massive stars explode as supernovae.
<br><br>
These stellar deaths create and disperse heavy elements, which later form planets and life. In this way, stars are central to cosmic evolution and existence itself.

<!-- BLACK HOLES -->
<section id="blackholes">
<h2>Black Holes and Neutron Stars</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543722530-d2c3201371e7?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Black Hole">
<p>
Black holes and neutron stars are among the most extreme objects in the universe. They are formed when massive stars collapse after exhausting their nuclear fuel. A black hole’s gravity is so intense that not even light can escape once it crosses the event horizon.
<br><br>
Neutron stars, while not as extreme as black holes, are incredibly dense. A single teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh billions of tons on Earth. These objects provide unique laboratories for studying physics under conditions that cannot be recreated on Earth.
<br><br>
Observations of gravitational waves and X-ray emissions have confirmed their existence and deepened our understanding of space-time.

<!-- SOLAR SYSTEM -->
<section id="solarsystem">
<h2>The Solar System in Detail</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614642264762-d0a3b8bf3700?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Solar System">
<p>
The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a rotating cloud of gas and dust. At its center lies the Sun, a stable star that provides energy and gravitational structure to the surrounding planets.
<br><br>
The eight planets vary widely, from rocky worlds like Earth and Mars to gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn. Moons, asteroids, and comets add further complexity to this dynamic system.
<br><br>
Studying our solar system offers insights into planetary formation, climate processes, and the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.

<!-- EXOPLANETS (FIXED IMAGE) -->
<section id="exoplanets">
<h2>Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580428180121-0a8b1c3c8b6d?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Exoplanet">
<p>
Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Since the first confirmed discovery in the 1990s, thousands of exoplanets have been identified using methods such as transit observation and radial velocity measurements.
<br><br>
Some exoplanets reside within the habitable zone of their stars, where temperatures may allow liquid water to exist. These discoveries challenge earlier assumptions about planetary systems and suggest that planets are common throughout the galaxy.
<br><br>
Future space telescopes aim to analyze exoplanet atmospheres for chemical signatures that could indicate biological activity. The study of exoplanets brings humanity closer to answering one of the most profound questions in science: are we alone in the universe?

<!-- DARK MATTER -->
<section id="darkmatter">
<h2>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1500530855697-b586d89ba3ee?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Dark Matter">
<p>
Dark matter and dark energy make up the majority of the universe’s total content, yet they remain invisible and poorly understood. Dark matter influences the motion of galaxies, while dark energy drives the accelerated expansion of the universe.
<br><br>
Although they cannot be observed directly, their effects are measurable through gravitational interactions and cosmic expansion rates. Unlocking their nature is one of the greatest challenges in modern physics.

<!-- SPACE-TIME -->
<section id="spacetime">
<h2>Space-Time and Relativity</h2>
<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534447677768-be436bb09401?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1600&q=80" alt="Space Time">
<p>
Space and time are interconnected into a four-dimensional structure known as space-time. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, massive objects curve space-time, creating gravity.
<br><br>
Relativity has been confirmed through experiments and observations, including gravitational lensing and time dilation. It remains essential for understanding black holes, cosmology, and modern technology such as GPS.
