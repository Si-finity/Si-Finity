<!-- ========== FUNDAMENTALS ========== -->
<section id="fundamentals">
  <h2>Robotics Fundamentals</h2>

  <p>
    Robotics fundamentals introduce the essential building blocks of robotic systems. Every robot is a combination of mechanical design, electronics, and control logic. Understanding these components helps learners see how machines move, respond, and interact with their environment.
  </p>

  class="section-img"
  alt="Robotics fundamentals showing mechanical parts and electronics">

  <p>
    Mechanical structures determine how a robot moves, whether through wheels, arms, or legs. Actuators such as motors convert electrical signals into physical motion, while power systems ensure reliable operation. Stability, balance, and efficiency are all influenced by fundamental design choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Control systems act as the robot’s brain, processing data and making decisions. Learning robotics fundamentals builds a strong technical mindset, allowing beginners to progress smoothly into advanced programming and intelligent robotics applications with confidence.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========== PROGRAMMING ========== -->
<section id="programming">
  <h2>Programming for Robotics</h2>

  <p>
    Programming gives robots the ability to think, react, and perform tasks autonomously. Without programming, a robot is simply a collection of hardware components. Code transforms machines into intelligent systems capable of decision-making and problem-solving.
  </p>

  class="section-img"
  alt="Robotics programming and electronics">

  <p>
    Robotics programming focuses on logic, sequencing, and control. Learners begin with simple instructions such as movement and obstacle avoidance, then progress toward complex behaviors. Concepts like loops, conditions, and variables are essential for efficient robotic control.
  </p>

  <p>
    Programming robots also teaches structured thinking and debugging skills. These skills extend beyond robotics into software development, automation, and artificial intelligence. Mastering robotic programming opens the door to innovation across multiple industries.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========== AI & SENSORS ========== -->
<section id="ai">
  <h2>AI & Sensors in Robotics</h2>

  <p>
    Artificial intelligence and sensors allow robots to perceive and understand their surroundings. Sensors act as a robot’s senses, collecting data such as distance, temperature, sound, and light. This data enables robots to respond intelligently to changing environments.
  </p>

  class="section-img"
  alt="Artificial intelligence sensors in robotics">

  <p>
    AI algorithms analyze sensor data to make predictions and decisions. Robots can learn from experience, recognize patterns, and adapt their behavior. This capability is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical robots, and smart assistants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning about AI and sensors introduces students to machine learning, data processing, and intelligent automation. These technologies represent the future of robotics and redefine how machines collaborate with humans.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========== FUTURE ========== -->
<section id="future">
  <h2>The Future of Robotics & Learning</h2>

  <p>
    The future of robotics is deeply connected to education and lifelong learning. As technology evolves, robots will become more integrated into daily life, assisting humans in complex and meaningful ways. Preparing for this future requires continuous learning and adaptability.
  </p>

  class="section-img"
  alt="Future robotics and automation technology">

  <p>
    Robotics education will increasingly focus on interdisciplinary skills, combining engineering, programming, ethics, and creativity. Learners will design robots that not only perform tasks efficiently but also align with human values and societal needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Si-Finity envisions a future where robotics learning empowers individuals to shape technology responsibly. By fostering curiosity and innovation, we help learners become creators of the future rather than passive consumers of technology.
